## Hello!

I am a Program Manager living in sunny Austin, TX. I have been working in the digital world for the past 15 years, first in advertising, then software. After spending 10 years in NYC, I relocated to Austin almost 7 years ago. I am currently working as a [Design, Technology and Innovation Fellow](https://cityofaustin.github.io/innovation-fellows/) with the City of Austin. 

You can keep up with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahshields/), visit my resume and project pages, or contact me at sarah(at)sarahshields.me
